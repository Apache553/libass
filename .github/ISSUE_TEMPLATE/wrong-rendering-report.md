**Compare to VSFilter**
Before reporting an issue, If possible, check what your file looks like in a video player that uses VSFilter to render subtitles (for example, MPC-HC). If it looks the same, even if it still feels wrong, this is probably intentional and not an issue with libass.

**Show screenshots**
If possible, add a screenshot of the file in libass (mpv, VLC, Kodi, MPlayer) that shows the wrong rendering, and a screenshot of the same file in a different renderer/video player (for example, MPC-HC) that shows the correct rendering.

**Show the ASS code**
If possible, show an excerpt of the ASS script that looks wrong. Include the relevant Dialogue and Style lines. If you can’t make an excerpt, we can work with a full ASS file if you tell us the time at which the problem occurs.

**Provide a full sample**
If you see the problem with a particular video file that contains subtitles, try to upload a short cut from the video file that we can play to see the problem. You can use tools such as MKVToolNix to make a smaller cut from a large file.

**Include the font**
If an uncommon font is needed to see the wrong rendering, upload it as a file if you have permission to do so. If it is a free font available on the Web, you can instead give a link to it.

**Describe what’s wrong**
Tell us clearly and concisely what you think looks wrong. Even if you show a screenshot, it is not always obvious to another person what you think is the problem.

**Describe what it should look like**
If you don’t have screenshots to show this but you know what the correct picture should be, tell us about it.

**Anything else**
Feel free to add anything else that may be useful.
